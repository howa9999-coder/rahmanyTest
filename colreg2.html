                <h2>Introduction to the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs)</h2>
                <p>
                    The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) are the globally recognized rules governing maritime navigation to ensure safety and prevent collisions between vessels. Established by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) and first adopted in 1972, these regulations provide standardized procedures for:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Steering and Sailing Rules</b> (Right-of-way, overtaking, crossing, and head-on situations)</li>
                    <li><b>Lights and Shapes</b> (Visual signals for day and night)</li>
                    <li><b>Sound and Light Signals</b> (Fog signals, maneuvering warnings)</li>
                    <li><b>Responsibilities of Vessels</b> (Based on type, size, and operational status)</li>
                    <li><b></b></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why Are COLREGs Important?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Universal Standardization</b> – Ensures all mariners follow the same rules, reducing confusion.</li>
                    <li><b>Collision Prevention</b> – Clear guidelines for navigation in all conditions (good visibility, restricted visibility, and emergencies).</li>
                    <li><b>Legal Framework</b> – Used in accident investigations to determine fault and liability.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The COLREGs include 41 rules divided into six sections:</h3>
                <h4>Part A - General (Rules 1-3)</h4>
                <h4>Part B - Steering and sailing (Rules 4-19)</h4>
                <h4>Part C - Lights and shapes (Rules 20-31)</h4>
                <h4>Part D - Sound and light signals (Rules 32-37)</h4>
                <h4>Part E - Exemptions</h4>
                <h4>Part F - Verification of compliance with the provisions of the Convention (Rules 39-41)</h4>

                <h3>The COLREGs include four annexes:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Annex I - Positioning and technical details of lights and shapes</li>
                    <li>Annex II - Additional signals for fishing vessels fishing in close proximity</li>
                    <li>Annex III - Technical details of sounds signal appliances</li>
                    <li>Annex IV - Distress signals, which lists the signals indicating distress and need of assistance.</li>

                </ul>

                <ol type="a">
                  <li>These Rules shall apply to all vessels upon the high seas and in all waters connected therewith navigable by seagoing vessels.</li>
                  <li>Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of special rules made by an appropriate authority for roadsteads, harbours, rivers, lakes or inland waterways connected with the high seas and navigable by seagoing vessels. Such special rules shall conform as closely as possible to these Rules.</li>
                  <li>Nothing in these Rules shall interfere with the operation of any special rules made by the Government of any State with respect to additional station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals for ships of war and vessels proceeding under convoy, or with respect to additional station or signal lights or shapes for fishing vessels engaged in fishing as a fleet. These additional station or signal lights, shapes or whistle signals shall, so far as possible, be such that they cannot be mistaken for any light, shapes or signal authorized elsewhere under these Rules.</li>
                  <li>Traffic separation schemes may be adopted by the Organization for the purpose of these Rules.</li>
                  <li>Whenever the Government concerned shall have determined that a vessel of special construction or purpose cannot comply fully with the provisions of any of these Rules with respect to the number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances, such vessel shall comply with such other provisions in regard to the number, position, range or arc of visibility of lights or shapes, as well as to the disposition and characteristics of sound-signalling appliances, as her Government shall have determined to be the closest possible compliance with these Rules in respect to that vessel.</li>

                                <p><b>"Safe speed"</b> is not fixed—it depends on real-time conditions.</p>
                                <p><b>"All vessels"</b> must adjust speed based on factors like visibility, traffic, and maneuverability.</p>
                                <p><b>"Radar-equipped vessels"</b> have additional responsibilities in assessing speed.</p>
                              
                                <h3>Factors to Consider When Determining Safe Speed</h3>

                                <p><b>State of visibility</b></p>
                                <p>In fog, rain, or darkness, reduce speed to allow more reaction time.</p>
                                
                                <p><b>Traffic density</b></p>
                                <p>Higher traffic (e.g., shipping lanes, fishing fleets) requires slower speeds.</p>
                                
                                <p><b>Maneuverability of the vessel</b></p>
                                <p>Large ships (e.g., tankers) need more distance to stop or turn.</p>
                                <p>Small boats may stop quickly but are harder to detect.</p>

                                  <h5>(i) Compass Bearing Steady = Risk of Collision</h5>
                                  <p>If the compass bearing of an approaching vessel does not change significantly, a collision risk exists (even if distance is decreasing slowly).</p>
                                  <p><strong>Why?</strong> A steady bearing with decreasing range means both vessels are on a collision course.</p>
                                  
                                  <h5>(ii) Exceptions Where Risk May Still Exist Despite Bearing Change</h5>
                                  <p>When approaching <strong>very large vessels</strong> (VLCCs, container ships):</p>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>A small bearing change may not be enough—their size means collision risk remains until well clear.</li>
                                  </ul>
                                  <p>When near a <strong>tug & tow or long vessel</strong>:</p>
                                  <ul>
                                    <li>The towed object may not be aligned with the tug's movement, creating hidden risks.</li>

                                  <ul>

                                    <li>Prevents misjudgment by requiring thorough risk assessment.</li>
                                    <li>Mandates technology use (radar, AIS) for better situational awareness.</li>

                                  <h3>Practical Example</h3>

                                <li>Stay to the <strong>starboard (right) side</strong> of the channel when proceeding along it.</li>
                                <li>Small vessels (&lt;20m) & sailing boats must not obstruct larger vessels confined to the channel.</li>
                                <li>Fishing vessels must not block passage of other ships in narrow channels.</li>
                                <li>Crossing is allowed only if it does not impede traffic moving along the channel.</li>
                                <li>Overtaking requires proper sound signals and cooperation between vessels.</li>
                                <li>Extra caution is needed near bends or blind spots (with sound signals).</li>
                                <li>Avoid anchoring in narrow channels unless absolutely necessary.</li>

                              <h4>(a) Keep to the Starboard Side</h4>
                              <blockquote>"Keep as near to the outer limit on the starboard side as is safe"</blockquote>
                              <ul>
                                <li>Ships moving along the channel should stay right (like road traffic).</li>
                                <li>Exception: If unsafe due to shallow water, obstructions, or other vessels.</li>

                                <li>Vessels &lt;20m or sailboats must avoid blocking larger ships that can only navigate safely in the channel.</li>
                                <li><strong>Example:</strong> A yacht must not loiter in the middle of a shipping lane.</li>

                                <li>Even while fishing, they must not block the path of vessels restricted to the channel.</li>
                                <li><strong>Example:</strong> A trawler must adjust its nets to allow a tanker to pass.</li>

                                      <li>Different tack (wind on different sides) → Port tack yields to starboard tack</li>
                                      <li>Same tack (wind on same side) → Windward boat yields to leeward boat</li>
                                      <li>Uncertainty about wind direction → Assume you must give way</li>

                   <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 600; text-align: center;">Rule 18 establishes a hierarchy of right-of-way between different types of vessels. It clarifies which vessels must give way to others based on their maneuverability and activities.</p>

                                  ample time, provided that when such action consists of an alteration of course, so far as possible the
                                  following shall be avoided:

                                          hears apparently forward of her beam the fog signal of another vessel, or which cannot avoid a close
                                          quarters situation with another vessel forward of her beam, shall reduce her speed to the minimum
                                          at which she can be kept on her course. She shall if necessary take all her way off and in any event
                                          navigate with extreme caution until danger of collision is over.

            A non-displacement craft is a type of boat or ship that does not push water aside (displace it) as it moves. Instead, it rides on top of the water at high speeds, often supported by lift (like hydrofoils, hovercraft, or planing hulls).
